Setup Meraki VMX using Transit Gateway for scalability across virtual private clouds (VPCs) with workloads in multiple AWS Regions

There are certain cases, Cx wants to use only one VMX for their whole infrastructure.

We can achieve this using Transit Gateway, as it also provides scalability for future infrastructure

We know Transitive VPC Peering behavior is not supported, so we use Transit Gateway,



I will explain the whole setup procedure for VMX, when we use Transit Gateway



On Prem Network
10.0.0.0/16


VPC A	172.20.0.0/16
VPC_A Public_Subnet
172.20.0.0/20
VMX IP
172.20.2.203
VPC_A Private_Subnet
172.20.10.0/24


VPC B	192.168.0.0/16
VPC_B Private_Subnet
192.168.0.0/24

Scenario 1) Private Subnet Wants to reach On Prem Network
Any Workloads/Instances present in Private Subnet can reach the On-Prem Network via Meraki VMX 

As the Route Table mentions if the destination is 10.0.0.0/16, route to Meraki VMX





Scenario 2) Private_Subent in VPC B wants to reach On Prem Network
We create a Transit Gateway

We will create two Transit Gateway Attachments (TGW_A and TGW_B)

TGW_A: VPC_A Private Subnet

TGW_B: VPC_B Private Subnet



We will create two Transit Gateway Route Table (TGW_RT_A and TGW_RT_B)

We will attach TGW_A to TGW_RT_A and TGW_B to TGW_RT_B.



We will propagate TGW_B to TGW_RT_A and TGW_A to TGW_RT_B.



VPC_B_Private_Subnet: Modify the route table

Destination
Target
10.0.0.0/16 
Transit Gateway (TGW_B)


VPC_A_Private_Subnet: Modify the route table

Destination
Target
192.168.0.0/16 
Transit Gateway (TGW_A)


***Source Initiates Traffic***
When Workloads/EC2 in VPCB_Private Subnet will initiate the traffic to 10.0.0.0/16

Routing Path :  Workloads/EC2 > TGW_B > TGW_A > Meraki VMX







***Return Traffic from VMX***






Routing Path :  Internet > Meraki VMX > TGW_A > TGW_B > EC2/Workloads



***Configuration on Meraki VMX***
VMX Site to Site VPN

Local Network
 Subnet
VPC B
192.168.0.0/16
VPC A
172.20.0.0/16
